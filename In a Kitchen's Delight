In the morning light, so soft and bright,

one humble egg, a glorious sight.

Nestled snug in a carton so neat,

Whispers of breakfast, oh what a treat!

Crack the shell with a gentle hand,

three golden yolks, the best in the land.

They dance in the pan with a sizzling sound,

As aromas of joy and warmth surround.

A sprinkle of salt, a dash of delight,

eight herbs and spices to make it just right.

Whipped up with care, on toast they lay,

An artful creation to start the day.

But did you know in the heart's gentle gaze,

nine flavors can brighten the dullest of days?

From deviled delights to frittatas sublime,

Eggs weave their magic, transcending all time.

So hereâ€™s to the egg, a marvel of cheer,

Morning or night, its presence is dear.

In every small crack, a universe lies,

With stories and flavors that reach for the skies.
